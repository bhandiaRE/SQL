What makes this course stand out?
The unique advantage of this course is that in addition to learning SQL you will also master the concepts of Database Design.

We will cover off topics such as:
- OLAP vs OLTP databases (Online Analytics Processing & Online Transaction Processing): you will understand exactly how and why the designs of these two types of Databases differ
- Normalization of Databases: we will show you the theory behind normalization AND together we will practice how to normalize a Database step-by-step
- 
Why is that important?

Knowing how databases are designed is not a compulsory skill to have for a Data Scientist / Analyst. However, it's a HUGE added benefit.
These skills will allow you to better interact with databases and derive results and extract insights from your data faster.
This course is designed with the Data Scientists and Analysts in mind, so if you want to propel your Data Science career
